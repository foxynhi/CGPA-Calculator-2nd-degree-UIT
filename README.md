# CGPA Calculator

This project is a **Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) Calculator** designed for students pursuing a 2nd Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology at UIT. The program allows users to manage course data, calculate GPA/CGPA, and optionally save or load data from files.

---

## Features

- **Student Management**: Each student has a unique ID, name, and a list of courses taken.
- **Course Management**: Add, update, delete, and retrieve course details.
- **Semester Management**: Organize courses into semesters and calculate GPA for each semester.
- **CGPA Calculation**: Calculate CGPA based on semester GPAs or individual course grades.
- **File Handling**: Load course data from CSV files and save results to files.

## Concepts Used

This project demonstrates the following programming concepts:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Structures: `Student`, `Course`, `CourseList`, `Semester`, `Node`.
   - Constructors and Destructors: Used for initialization and cleanup.

2. **Data Structures**:
   - **Linked Lists**: Each semester is implemented as a linked list of courses (`Node`).
   - **Array of Linked Lists**: `CourseList` contains an array of `Semester` objects.

3. **File Handling**:
   - Reading and writing CSV files for course data.
   - Using `ifstream` and `ofstream` for file operations.

4. **Algorithms**:
   - Searching: Find courses by ID.
   - GPA/CGPA Calculation: Arithmetic operations to compute weighted averages.

5. **Standard Libraries**:
   - `iostream`: Input/output operations.
   - `fstream`: File handling.
   - `sstream`: String stream for parsing CSV data.
   - `cmath`: Mathematical operations (e.g., rounding).

## How It Works

1. **Data Representation**:
   - Each `Student` contains a `CourseList` and other details like ID and name.
   - `CourseList` is an array of `Semester` objects.
   - Each `Semester` is a linked list of `Node` objects, where each `Node` represents a `Course`.

2. **Key Functionalities**:
   - **Add Course**: Add a course to a specific semester.
   - **Delete Course**: Remove a course by ID and semester.
   - **Update Course**: Modify course details.
   - **Calculate GPA**: Compute GPA for a semester.
   - **Calculate CGPA**: Compute CGPA across all semesters.

3. **File Handling**:
   - Load course data from a CSV file using `initDataFromCSV`.
   - Save student data to a file for future retrieval.
